Real-Time Communication Monitor
Overview
This PowerShell script, named "RealTimeCommunicationMonitor.ps1," is designed to monitor the stability of a real-time communication protocol on a local connection. The script begins by setting the execution policy to RemoteSigned for the current user, allowing the execution of locally created scripts. It then enters an infinite loop, periodically testing the stability of the specified communication server using the Test-NetConnection cmdlet. In the event of a stable connection, it outputs a message indicating the stability. However, if the connection is interrupted, it raises a warning of a potential attack, logging the attacker's IP address and retrieving its geolocation using the ipinfo.io API. The script provides a detailed response to potential threats, allowing users to analyze and respond to security incidents promptly.

Features
Dynamic IP Address Retrieval: The script dynamically determines the local communication server's IP address, adapting to both IPv4 and IPv6 environments.
Automated Response: In the event of a connection interruption, the script identifies the attacker's IP address and retrieves its geolocation, facilitating a quick and automated response to potential security threats.
Error Handling: A try-catch block is implemented to handle potential errors during the connection test, ensuring the script's robustness and providing detailed error messages for troubleshooting.
Geolocation Information: The script leverages the ipinfo.io API to obtain geolocation information about the attacker's IP address, enhancing the details available for incident analysis.
Usage
Execution Policy: Ensure that the execution policy is set to RemoteSigned for the current user using the provided command: Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force.

Run the Script: Execute the script, and it will continuously monitor the real-time communication protocol's stability on the specified server.

Automated Response: In the case of a detected attack, the script provides information about the attacker's IP address and geolocation, enabling users to implement automated responses such as blocking IPs or generating alerts for further investigation.

Note
This script serves as a basic real-time communication protocol monitor and can be extended or integrated into larger security frameworks, utilizing centralized logging and analysis tools for a comprehensive security solution.
